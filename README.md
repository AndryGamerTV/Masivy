HTML (to_do_list.html)
The HTML file sets up a basic webpage structure:

- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type.
- The <html> tag defines the root of an HTML document.
- The <head> section contains meta-information about the document, including the character set, title, and links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
- The <body> section contains the content of the document, including an (h1) header with some nested (span) elements for styling purposes.
